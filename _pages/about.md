I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Dr. Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/saibal-mukhopadhyay). My current research focuses on leveraging _scarce, offline data collected from robotics and human demonstrations, including suboptimal policies, to develop efficient and adaptive robot learning algorithms with strong learning-theoretic guarantees_.

My research sits at the intersection of **deep learning, probabilistic modeling, and reinforcement learning**, equipping me to tackle these challenges from multiple angles. One branch of my work enhances robotic sensing and perception by treating it as a closed-loop system, enabling robots to introspect and dynamically balance perception quality, task performance, and resource consumption. Another branch focuses on developing adaptive learning algorithms that efficiently learn from suboptimal offline data, leading to a better understanding of system dynamics and improved decision-making in real-world scenarios. This unique positioning enables me to bridge these paradigms, transforming today’s powerful models into more general, adaptable, and reasoning-driven autonomous agents capable of making robust decisions in complex, real-world environments. 

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I was a part of the SeDriCa team at IIT Bombay, where I worked on the end-to-end software design for an autonomous vehicle, covering everything from perception to control.


<!-- Hi, I am Hemant! I am a fourth-year ECE Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology advised by [Prof. Dr. Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/saibal-mukhopadhyay). I graduated in 2020 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Minor degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

I possess a strong background in self-driving car technology, encompassing computer vision, planning, control, and localization. My research interests span computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning, with a focus on improving the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems. Currently, I’m actively engaged in research projects related to partial observability prediction and data-efficient computer vision for adaptive automotive sensing. -->
