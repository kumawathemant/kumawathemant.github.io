Hi, I am Hemant! I am a third-year ECE Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology advised by [Prof. Dr. Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/saibal-mukhopadhyay). I graduated in 2020 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Minor degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

I possess a strong background in self-driving car technology, encompassing computer vision, planning, control, and localization. My research interests span computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning, with a focus on improving the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems. Currently, I’m actively engaged in research projects related to partial observability prediction and data-efficient computer vision for adaptive automotive sensing.
