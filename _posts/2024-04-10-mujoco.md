## Iâ€™m Writing This Because Every Time I Install MuJoCo, I Face the Same Issues...
Every. Single. Time. So hereâ€™s my attempt to save someone (maybe even my future self) from the headache of getting MuJoCo up and running on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. Whether youâ€™re new to MuJoCo or youâ€™ve been battling it for a while, this guide should help you dodge the common pitfalls. Iâ€™m even throwing in some tips for installing it with Conda because thatâ€™s where things often go sideways!

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide for Ubuntu
Letâ€™s get MuJoCo up and running on a regular Ubuntu setup. Then, weâ€™ll dive into the Conda madness.

### Step 1: Download the MuJoCo Software
1. Head to [MuJoCo's website](https://mujoco.org/).
2. Grab the latest `mujoco210` package. You should get a `.tar.gz` file.
3. Unzip it to your home directory:
   
   \`\`\`bash
   unzip mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -d ~/.mujoco
   \`\`\`

4. Now you should have MuJoCo sitting comfortably in `~/.mujoco/mujoco210`.

### Step 2: Get the License Key (If Needed)
Older versions need a key, but the newer ones are free! If you need a key (`mjkey.txt`), place it in `~/.mujoco`.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
We need some dependencies to make sure MuJoCo plays nice with Ubuntu:

For **Ubuntu 18.04**:
\`\`\`bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3
\`\`\`

For **Ubuntu 20.04**:
\`\`\`bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3 patchelf
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
Open up your `.bashrc` file and add these environment variables:
\`\`\`bash
nano ~/.bashrc
\`\`\`

Add:
\`\`\`bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin
export MUJOCO_PY_MUJOCO_PATH=~/.mujoco/mujoco210
export MUJOCO_PY_MJKEY_PATH=~/.mujoco/mjkey.txt
\`\`\`

Update the terminal:
\`\`\`bash
source ~/.bashrc
\`\`\`

### Step 5: Install `mujoco-py` with pip
If you want to use Python, youâ€™ll need `mujoco-py`:
\`\`\`bash
pip install mujoco-py
\`\`\`

### Step 6: Test It!
Run a quick Python test to make sure itâ€™s working:
\`\`\`python
python -c "import mujoco_py"
\`\`\`

## MuJoCo Installation with Conda
Now, letâ€™s get into the fun stuff: setting up MuJoCo with Conda. If you prefer using virtual environments (which you should), Conda is a solid choice, but it does come with its quirks.

### Step 1: Create a Conda Environment
Create a new Conda environment for your project:
\`\`\`bash
conda create -n mujoco_env python=3.8
conda activate mujoco_env
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Install Dependencies via Conda
Conda makes dependency management a bit easier, so letâ€™s use it:
\`\`\`bash
conda install -c conda-forge glfw glew
\`\`\`

Note: If youâ€™re on Ubuntu 20.04, you might still need `libosmesa6-dev`:
\`\`\`bash
sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev patchelf
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Download & Setup MuJoCo
Do the usual MuJoCo download:
\`\`\`bash
wget https://mujoco.org/download/mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
mkdir ~/.mujoco && tar -xvzf mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -C ~/.mujoco
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables for Conda
Add MuJoCo to the Conda environment:
\`\`\`bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin
\`\`\`

Or, if you want it to persist in your Conda environment, create an `activate.d` script:
\`\`\`bash
mkdir -p ~/anaconda3/envs/mujoco_env/etc/conda/activate.d
nano ~/anaconda3/envs/mujoco_env/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
\`\`\`

Add:
\`\`\`bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin
export MUJOCO_PY_MUJOCO_PATH=~/.mujoco/mujoco210
export MUJOCO_PY_MJKEY_PATH=~/.mujoco/mjkey.txt
\`\`\`

### Step 5: Install `mujoco-py` in Conda
Use pip to install `mujoco-py` in the Conda environment:
\`\`\`bash
pip install mujoco-py
\`\`\`

### Step 6: Test It in the Conda Environment
Do the same quick test:
\`\`\`python
python -c "import mujoco_py"
\`\`\`

## Common Issues and Debugging (Conda & Native)
Hereâ€™s a refresher on some common headaches and their fixes.

### 1. Conda Environment Not Recognizing MuJoCo
**Problem**: MuJoCo binaries arenâ€™t getting picked up in your Conda environment.

**Solution**: Make sure your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set properly in the environment variables. Verify with:
\`\`\`bash
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
\`\`\`
And ensure it includes the MuJoCo path.

### 2. Issues with OpenGL or GLFW
**Problem**: If MuJoCo crashes with rendering errors in Conda, you probably have an OpenGL or GLFW problem.

**Solution**: Use Conda to manage GLFW:
\`\`\`bash
conda install -c conda-forge glfw
\`\`\`
And make sure your system has the right graphics drivers.

### 3. Segmentation Faults Inside Conda
**Problem**: You get mysterious segmentation faults when trying to run simulations in Conda.

**Solution**: Check if you need to install additional dependencies via apt:
\`\`\`bash
sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev patchelf
\`\`\`
And always make sure your Conda environmentâ€™s Python version matches what `mujoco-py` likes (Python 3.6 to 3.8 is usually safe).

## Wrapping It Up
MuJoCo can be finicky, but once youâ€™ve got it going, itâ€™s a powerhouse for simulations. Whether youâ€™re running native or in a Conda environment, I hope this guide helps you skip the drama and get straight to coding those fancy RL models.

Good luck, happy simulating, and may your virtual robots stay upright! ðŸ¤–
