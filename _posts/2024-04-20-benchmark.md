Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained tremendous traction in recent years, achieving remarkable success in various domains such as robotics, gaming, and autonomous driving. A key aspect of advancing RL research is the ability to benchmark algorithms effectively. To make this possible, researchers use a variety of standardized environments, libraries, and tools that allow for fair comparisons and consistent evaluation of different RL strategies. This blog will introduce some of the most common tools in RL for benchmarking.
